st.header("Instructions")
st.write(" 1. Choose a COVID-19 API of your choice that contains both valuable data and noise. \n 2. Use Python to gather the data from the API and store it in a Pandas DataFrame. \n 3. Clean the data by removing any irrelevant columns, null values, or duplicates. \n 4. Pre-process the data by normalizing and scaling the numerical data. \n 5. Perform EDA to identify trends, correlations, and patterns in the data. Use visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and heatmaps to help you understand the data better. \n 6. Choose the best-suited supervised algorithm to predict the future number of cases. Use techniques such as train-test split, cross-validation, and grid search to optimize the model's performance. \n 7. Once you have chosen the best-suited model, deploy it using Streamlit. Create a user-friendly interface that allows users to input data and view the model's predictions. \n 8. Deploy your streamlit app with streamlit share")
